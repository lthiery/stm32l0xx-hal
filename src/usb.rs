//! Support code for working with the USB peripheral
//!
//! This module is different from the other peripheral APIs, in the sense that
//! it isn't really a peripheral API, just some support code to make working
//! with the USB peripheral possible. This is due to the existing STM32
//! ecosystem support for USB.
//!
//! As USB seems to work mostly the same across all STM32 MCUs, there is a
//! single crates that supports USB for these MCUs:
//! [`stm32-usbd`](https://crates.io/crates/stm32-usbd)
//!
//! Since `stm32-usbd` depends on the HAL libraries for each STM32 family it
//! supports, we can't exactly depend on it to provide everything you need here.
//! Instead, we just provide some code that takes care of the platform-specific
//! bits, which you can call before using `stm32-usbd` for the rest.
//!
//! Please check out the USB examples in the `examples/` directory to see how it
//! fits together.
